				"You can rob a creature of one of its inherent aptitudes and give that capability to an ally. Choose one ability score. One creature of your choice within range makes a saving throw with that ability score. On a failure, the target has disadvantage on checks and saving throws with the chosen ability score. In addition, the target has disadvantage on attack rolls using the chosen ability score, and deals only half damage with such attacks if they are weapon attacks.When you cast this spell, choose another willing creature within 30 feet. For the duration, that creature gains advantage on all ability checks and saving throws with the ability score you chose. In addition, that creature gains 25 temporary hit points.At the end of each of the first target's turns, it can make a saving throw against the spell. It makes the saving throw with the ability score you chose, but the disadvantage inflicted by this spell does not affect saving throws against it. On a successful save, the spell ends"
